We want to understand more about the movies that families are watching. The following categories are considered family movies: 
Animation, Children, Classics, Comedy, Family and Music.

Create a query that lists each movie, the film category it is classified in, and the number of times it has been rented out.*/

Now we need to know how the length of rental duration of these family-friendly movies compares to the 
duration that all movies are rented for. Can you provide a table with the movie titles and divide them 
into 4 levels (first_quarter, second_quarter, third_quarter, and final_quarter) based on the quartiles 
(25%, 50%, 75%) of the rental duration for movies across all categories? Make sure to also indicate the

We would like to know who were our top 10 paying customers, how many payments they made on a monthly basis during 2007, and what was the
